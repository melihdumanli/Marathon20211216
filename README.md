# Marathon-2 (Hibernate)
This is a simple record store Java FX and console app.
I used ORM (Hibernate and entity classes) to connect database, read and write datas. 
I designed two different pages for admins and users(customers).
Admins can add new products such as CD, DVD or Vinyl , remove or edit them. Also, admins can list orders, set products salable or not.
Users can see best sellers, list products by genres and add products to cart.
